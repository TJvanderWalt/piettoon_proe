# piettoon_proe

Die piettoon_proe repo op GitHub is bedoel om te leer hoe om Python projekte te bou;
op die "master branch" word moontlike projekte dus voorgestel, asook algemene besprekings oor
die bou van projekte aangetref; die "master branch" verdeel dan in "web_toep", "GUI_toep", "cmd_toep" en "mobi_toep" branches

13 Project ideas for INTERMEDIATE Python developers
Habeeb Sjopeju Mar 20, 2019

To build projects can help you to:
gain confidence to create software regardless the level of complexity;
explore other technologies needed to build a complete product (databases, 
servers, and other languages);
understand programming concepts better (better code, design patterns, OOP);
experience a complete software dev life cycle(plan before writing code, 
manage coding process, and update software)

***Command-line apps***
Work in a console window (i.e. command prompt on Windows)(Terminal in Mac and Linux);
no clicking - you have to type in commands (thus needs some technical knowledge about these commands);
look of command-line apps can be improved by adding colors to the text, using libraries such as colorama 
and colored;   https://pypi.org/project/colorama/     https://pypi.org/project/colored/
you can use frameworks such as Argparse, Docopt and Click

***Web apps***
Apps that run on the web, they can be accessed on any device without being downloaded, provided there 
is access to the internet;
a web app has a back end and front end;
back end is the part where the business logic is (back end code will manipulate and store data);
the front end is the interface of the app (it determines the look of a web app) and some knowledge
of HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript is needed;
OR use python code alone for both the front end and back end (no need for HTML, CSS, JavaScript) thanks
to the anvil library;    https://anvil.works/learn
you can use web frameworks to develop the web app - most popular is django and flask;

***Desktop GUI apps***
Apps on desktop/laptop;
you do not have to learn any front end technology to create Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps but can 
build all the parts using Python;
frameworks for building desktop applications include the user-friendly PySimpleGUI and the advanced PyQT5 
that is quite powerful but with a steep learning curve;
software you create for Desktop GUI is able to work on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems - all you 
have to do after creating the project is compile it to an executable for your operating system of choice
